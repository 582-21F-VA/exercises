# Exercise: Functions

For this assignment, your task is to implement the functions described
below. Don't forget to document each function with type annotations and
examples.

- A function that determines the weight of a given object on the Moon.
  On the Moon, an object weighs one sixth of its weight on Earth.

- A function that produces the greeting `"Hi <name>!"`, where `<name>`
  is the name of a given person.

- A function that calculates the total price of a given order of
  personalized pencils with a message. Each pencil costs 25 cents, plus
  2 additional cents for each character in the message, including
  spaces.

- A function that applies the provincial and federal taxes to a given
  subtotal. In Quebec, the federal tax (GST) is 5%, and the provincial
  tax (QST) is 9.975%.

- A function that turns a given sentence into a question. A sentence
  always ends with a period, while a question ends with a question mark.
  Be careful: a sentence may contain other periods besides the final one
  (e.g.: "J.D. Salinger is an author.").

The [length] property of a string can be used to get the number of
characters it contains. You will also need the built-in [slice]
function. Take some time to read their documentation, and understand how
they work.
